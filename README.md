Once you have learned ReactJS, go ahead and read about Progressive web apps. Now that you know frontend frameworks, it shouldn’t be that difficult for you. Have a look at the [PWA checklist](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist), read about service workers, measuring performance, using lighthouse and look at the different browser APIs that you can use to your advantage e.g. Storage, Location, Notifications, Device Orientation, and Payments. Also read about [RAIL model](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) and [PRPL pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/).

### Read

### Tasks

- [ ] Create a Pomodoro application similar to [this one](https://splode.github.io/pomotroid/) that lets the users configure the duration for work and breaks, shows notifications and plays a sound whenever work or break has ended/started.
- [ ] Re-create the GitHub [trending page](https://github.com/trending) using React and allow filtering using language and dates just like GitHub. You may add any libraries for dates.

## Phase 5: Testing

Learning to write automated tests for your applications is going to save you a lot of headache in the future and is going to put you in a better position when looking for a job.

- [ ] Learn what are the different types of testing, different concepts such as mocking, stubs etc.
- [ ] Learn to calculate the test coverage

> Once you understand basics of testing you can learn testing library specific for react or not

- [ ] Jest
- [ ] Enzyme
- [ ] Cypress

### Tasks

- [ ] For the tasks, go ahead and write unit, integration and functional tests for the application(s) that you created in Phase 4 above.

## Phase 6:  Static Type Checkers

Type checkers allow you to make your code more maintainable as it grows, increases your agility when doing refactoring, provide better support in the IDEs and are the best form of documentation that you can have. There are mainly Flow and TypeScript in this domain. However, there is more push towards TypeScript and I would recommend you to go with that.

- [ ] Typescript

### Tasks

- [ ] Go ahead and convert any of your existing JavaScript applications to use TypeScript

## Phase 7:  Server-Side Rendering & Static Site Generator

Server rendered applications allow achieving better performance and improved SEO as compared to the client rendered applications. Although not a requirement it would definitely help you in crafting better frontend applications. There are different options available, based on the frontend framework of your choice; but if you picked React.js then you should go with Next.js which makes SSR a breeze.

- [ ] Read blog about rendering types
  - [ ] SSG
  - [ ] SSR
  - [ ] Hydration
  - [ ] etc
- [ ] Next.js

### Tasks

- [ ] Create your personal blog and import all your posts

## Go Beyond

Everything shown in this phase is optional and is not really required for you but if you would like to try them out, go ahead and have a look.

- [ ] Learn about Node & Express a little

### Tasks

- [ ] Create a simple crud application using simple backend or BaaS

### Create a portfolio website and put all these project in there or just put your fork of this repo in there

Where to get the design? Because you are a frontend developer not a designer and people say you must have a great looking portfolio site to attract and showcase what you know to potential clients and employers. I have no idea on this one🤷‍.
